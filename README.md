[Crusher](https://crusher.dev) 🦖 is a faster  testing framework, an alternative to traditional workflows using cypress, selenium, etc.

**Create, run and debug tests** with dead simple workflow, use **low-code or code**. We're reimagining testing to make it blazingly simple, fast and effective.

## 💡 Philosophy

If you are involved in software development, you must know what happens when things goes wrong. 

It seems like every time you push a button, something breaks. This makes us so frustrated that we don't want to push the buttons anymore.

Testing solves this, but it hasn't evolved. We're changing it by creating integrate solution that simply works.


## 🧱 Deployment

**Crusher cloud 🏖️** Start using |  Zero configuration setup. Recommended: Faster, cheaper and less hassle.

**Self host 🧱** - Deploy using docker or kubernetes. 

Read docs on how to deploy locally, or on AWS, GCP, etc.
