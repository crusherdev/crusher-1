## 💡 Philosophy

Softwares are getting more complex, we are entering API driven ecosystem.

This leads to angry customers, stakeholder and your product/startup becomes chaotic which could be avoided easily.

Knowing when/where things break is very critical. Good workflow are needed to make it simple to deliver HQ software fast.

## 😎 What's so cool about this

Testing is not new. There are tons of solutions out there, still testing is an unsolved piece of the puzzle in the dev lifecycle.

We try to reimagine how testing should work. Few things that differentiate us

1.) UI first approach. The web is about how it looks, and we help you ship pixel-perfect UIs. As devs, we work hard to build software. Although, in the process, some tasks are boring, grueling, & eat up our time.

2.) No-code/low-code for primitive action. We use no-code to detect primitive user actions.

3.) Removing noise from dev workflow. We are reimagining how processed, should be.

4.) Making things simple and fast. We take inspiration from Figma, Linear :D.

## 🛣️ Some testing use cases

- E2E functional testing while developing
- Testing responsiveness of your UIs.
- Setup alerts on Production system
- Ship fast and keep your software robust.
- Or maybe keeping an eye on your competitor 👀

## Is Crusher the right choice for me?
- Do you want to have complete testing suite?
- Does your site break in production and staging?
- Do you want a super simple to use software?
- Do you care about quality of your web app?

If the answers to the above are YES, then Crusher would be a great fit for your
application. Crusher integrates seamlessly into most application in < 5 mins.
